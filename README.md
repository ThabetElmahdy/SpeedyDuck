# SpeedyDuck
A repository for the Speedy Duck robot, a versatile differential drive robot designed for SLAM, path planning, and navigation. The robot utilizes ROS 2 (Foxy), the Nav2 stack, and ROS 2 Control for autonomous navigation in both simulation (using Gazebo) and real-life (on a Raspberry Pi).
